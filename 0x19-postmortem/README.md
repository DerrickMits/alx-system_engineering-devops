Postmortem Report: Server Outage on August 16, 2024
Issue Summary
Duration: August 16, 2024, 2:15 PM - 4:00 PM (EAT)
Impact: Our main e-commerce platform experienced a severe slowdown, with users unable to complete transactions. Approximately 75% of our users were affected, leading to a significant drop in sales and customer dissatisfaction.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an uneven distribution of traffic, overwhelming a single server.
Timeline
2:15 PM: Issue detected when monitoring systems flagged increased response times and high error rates.
2:20 PM: The issue was confirmed by a support engineer who received multiple customer complaints about slow loading times.
2:25 PM: Initial investigation focused on database performance and application logs, assuming the problem might be related to database queries.
2:45 PM: Debugging revealed that the issue was not related to the database but rather to the load balancer configuration.
3:00 PM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for a deeper investigation.
3:15 PM: The DevOps team identified that a recent update to the load balancerâ€™s configuration caused uneven traffic distribution.
3:30 PM: The load balancer settings were corrected, and traffic was redistributed properly.
4:00 PM: System performance normalized, and monitoring systems confirmed that the issue was resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Cause: A recent configuration update to the load balancer had inadvertently altered the traffic distribution algorithm, causing one server to handle a disproportionate amount of traffic while others were underutilized. This led to the overloaded server becoming a bottleneck.
Fix: The DevOps team rolled back the load balancer configuration to its previous state and updated the traffic distribution rules to ensure an even load across all servers. They also implemented new checks to prevent similar issues in future updates.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Configuration Review Process: Implement a more rigorous review process for configuration changes, including peer reviews and automated checks.
Load Testing: Conduct load testing in staging environments to simulate high traffic scenarios before deploying changes to production.
Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring to include more detailed metrics on load balancer performance and traffic distribution.
Tasks:
Update Load Balancer Configuration: Apply the corrected configuration and verify it in staging before production deployment.
Enhance Monitoring: Add detailed metrics and alerts for load balancer performance and traffic distribution.
Conduct Load Testing: Develop and execute comprehensive load tests to simulate high traffic and identify potential bottlenecks.
Review Process Improvement: Establish a formal review process for configuration changes, including automated validation and peer reviews.
